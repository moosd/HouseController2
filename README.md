# HouseController2
Take 2 at implementing home automation. More modular and now being used regularly. This contains the android app.

## What does it work with?
It's an android app to control the home automation setup I have at https://github.com/moosd/HomeAutomation

Written in a modular fashion to add/remove components to control, allows multiple components per object to control. Already better than my previous attempt.

I am currently using this in my room, with no fussing around with trying to figure out which wire came loose...
